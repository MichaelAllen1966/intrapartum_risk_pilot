## Outcome measures

Possible measures:
* Apgar
* Apgar <7
* Perinatal death
* Apgar 5
* Intubation
* Intubation without meconium
* Transfer to SCBU
* Convulsions
* Composite: (i) 5-­minute Apgar score <7, (ii) neonatal resuscitation by intubation and positive pressure ventilation (with or without cardiac massage) and (iii) perinatal death (intra-partum and early neonatal death).
## Risk factors

Paper:
* Antenatal:
	* Suspected fetal growth restriction (FGR proxy is number of antenatal scans)
	* Previous CS
	* Nulliparity
	* Antepartum haemorrhage
	* Booking body mass index  (grouped)
	* Maternal age (grouped)
	* Maternal ethnicity
	* Gestational age at delivery  (grouped)
* Intrapartum:
	* Induction of labour
	* Epidural use
	* Oxytocin use
	* Maternal pyrexia
	* Abnormal FHR
	* Meconium-­stained amniotic fluid
	
* Suggested additions (PS, 15/9/23):
	* Single unsupported mother
	* Weeks of gestation at delivery rather than groups
	* Highest antenatal blood pressure
	* Duration of labour
* Suspected combinations?
	* FHR
	* Meconium
	* Pyrexia
	* Epidural
	* Duration of labour
